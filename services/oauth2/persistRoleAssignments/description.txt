For each role managed by the remote oauth2 system, we make sure the role exists (with no owner).
We then make sure a group with the same name as the role exists (to make sure it is uniquely named) where the owner is the current oauth2 node.
Then we make sure the user is in it.

We also select all the groups that belong to this oauth2 node and remove the user from any group that is not explicitly listed.
