The Administrator is the only standard global role which needs to have _every_ permission in _every_ context.
The Administrator role exists to solve a chicken/egg situation where any new context is inherently not configured. The administrator can bring order to this initial chaos.
Additionally, even if your security configuration goes horribly wrong, you can count on at least one super user account that can rectify things.

Note that the administrator is NOT linked to a context, so it applies to all data within a single scheme. Be careful.
