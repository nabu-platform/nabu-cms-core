You can actively forget a user by disabling the remember cookie.
It is called when the user explicitly logs out.

The best way to disable the remember combination is to actually authenticate it. This uses up the 1 use it has.
It is not entirely clean, but the alternative is an additional specification only to invalidate the authentications.

The service will also return all the permissions available to someone who is anonymous.
