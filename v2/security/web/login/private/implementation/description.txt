Login is aimed at web applications where a human user logs in and has a persistent interaction via the browser.
This entails that we assume device tracking is enabled and "remember me" is a viable option to make long-term authentication easier on the user.

We also send back additional information that can be used to optimize the user experience, for instance we send back potential roles and permissions to allow for easier toggling of frontend components.

Note that the remember only works if you have a valid device id. We want to ensure a remember can only be used from a specific device, not globally.
