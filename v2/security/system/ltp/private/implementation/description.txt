Generate a limited-time-use password combination to run a particular service.
The major usecase here is again file downloads, but with a slightly different take than OTP.
We don't couple the link to the device, allowing other people to use the link as well.
We generally don't couple the link to a correlation id, allowing broader use of the service.

OTP aims at maximum security, LTP aims to provide a balance between security and usability. Some use cases that can be interesting for LTP:

- generating a link with some (revokable) security that can still be shared
- downloading multiple files in a short time, an image gallery is a prime example of this
