Application Manager: can configure the application
Application Editor: can edit the screens in page builder
Application Tester: can test the application
Application Administrator: can do everything. We need at least one user with this role for the setup to be considered successful.

We provide a hook so other implementations can couple their own permissions as needed to these roles.

By default we allow anyone with an account to log in. However, registration is by default not available to guest.

System actions are the same across different applications, we _could_ create them without a context. However that makes them harder to pinpoint for management. In the future, additional features might also be added to action (like the audit already) that might differ per application.
