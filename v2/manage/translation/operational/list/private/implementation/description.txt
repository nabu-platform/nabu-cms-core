In the long run, we want security per instance id, but in the CMS context we can't guarantee the instance ids are actually nodes.
In the future we may also want to allow for batch instances but the usecase is small, it would need to be translation management in a repeat. More likely then not, the translations are managed in a seperate form even if it is originating from a repeat.
