    <description>This is meant to feed the user-centric view where you want to see all the children (within a context) where the user in question has certain roles.
The reason that this is limited to a context is for readability (roles may overlap cross context), security (it is harder to determine cross-context everything you are allowed to see and manage) and to apply (applying a role from another context to a node from this context accidently would probably not do what you want.</description>
